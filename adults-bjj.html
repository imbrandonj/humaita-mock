        <p>
          The Gracie Humaita Program Structure defines three main stages of development for students: the Fundamentals Program, the Advanced Program and the Black Belt Program. 
          These stages indicate different maturity levels and students upgrade from one to the other in their own natural progression.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the Fundamentals Program focuses on the building blocks and basic principles of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, the Advanced Program is built on high-level techniques and drills that start shaping the students game flow through the development of reflexes, speed and reaction time as well as transitions between one technique and another.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few months in the GHKC Advanced Program students typically experience a deeper involvement in GHKC's philosophy, a stronger bond with training partners as well as more discipline and commitment to healthy habits that keep them in good shape.
        </p>
        <p>  
          Advanced Program classes are based on a defined class structure and curriculum that take a broad and open-minded approach, incorporating techniques from different grappling styles like wrestling, judo, sambo, and, of course, Gracie Humaita Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
        </p>
        <p>
