## Performance Baseline (Original Site)

A Lighthouse audit on the original site failed to complete due to severe violations of modern web standards:

| Category       | Status     | Notes                                                      |
|----------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Performance    | ❌ Failed   | Browser tab crashed. Metrics like LCP, FCP, CLS could not be calculated. |
| Accessibility  | ❌ Failed   | ARIA roles, landmark elements, labels, and keyboard navigation all missing or broken. |
| Best Practices | ❌ Failed   | Uses deprecated APIs, lacks HTTPS, violates CSP and HSTS recommendations. |
| SEO            | ❌ Failed   | Missing `<title>`, `<meta description>`, alt text, canonical tag, and hreflang. |

Captured: **Apr 29, 2025, 12:40 PM CDT**  
Lighthouse Version: **12.4.0**  
Environment: **Desktop** with **Chromium 135.0.0.0**

> **Lighthouse Metric Summary:**
> - **Performance:**
>   - **LCP – Largest Contentful Paint:** How long it takes the main content to load.
>   - **FCP – First Contentful Paint:** When something first appears; shows the site is alive.
>   - **CLS – Cumulative Layout Shift:** Measures layout jumping as content loads; a poor UX signal.
>   - **TBT – Total Blocking Time:** How long the browser is unresponsive due to heavy script execution.
>   - If these fail to calculate, it means the site did not load properly or crashed during audit.
>
> - **Accessibility:**
>   - Measures whether the site is usable by people with disabilities, including screen readers and keyboard navigation.
>   - Includes presence of alt text, correct label associations, logical tab order, and ARIA roles.
>   - i.e., an ARIA role defines the purpose of the HTML element for screen reading technology
>   - If this fails, the site may be inaccessible or unusable for assistive technologies.
>
> - **Best Practices:**
>   - Assesses modern coding standards and site security.
>   - Includes HTTPS usage, no deprecated APIs, secure headers, and safe script behavior.
>   - Failures suggest technical debt and security or compatibility risks.
>
> - **SEO:**
>   - Evaluates if the site is optimized to be found and indexed by search engines.
>   - Includes `<title>`, meta description, canonical URL, structured data, and alt text.
>   - A failed score here results in poor search engine visibility.

## Optimization & Asset Management

- **Logo Format**  
  Replaced `cropped-Gracie-Production.png` with `logo.webp` for modern image compression.  
  _Why: WebP is a newer format that reduces file size without sacrificing quality, improving load times._

- **Favicon Update**  
  Converted tab icon from PNG to `.ico` format for cross-browser compatibility.  
  _Why: `.ico` is the standard favicon format supported across all browsers and platforms._

- **Hero Banner**  
  Converted hero image to WebP format, reducing size from **21,389KB → 276KB** (~99% reduction).  
  _Why: A smaller file drastically reduces load time, especially on mobile connections._

- **Content Images**  
  All content images converted to WebP format with device-based size selection.  
  Example: Helio PNG reduced from **250KB → 30KB**.  
  _Why: Reduces bandwidth usage and improves page speed across devices._

- **Responsive Image Loading**  
  Implemented `<picture>` elements and media queries to load appropriately sized images for mobile and desktop.  
  _Why: Delivers smaller images to mobile devices, improving load time and performance without sacrificing desktop quality._

## SEO & Semantic Improvements

- **Title Tag**  
  Added `<title>` tag with value "Gracie Humaita Kansas City".  
  _Why: Clear, concise titles improve search ranking and avoid keyword penalties. Without it, browsers may fall back to using the `<h1>` as the tab label._

- **Meta Description**  
  Added: "Gracie Humaita Kansas City offers competitive Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, self defense, and training for adults and kids."  
  _Why: Helps Google understand what the site is about and display a clean search snippet._

- **Keyword Strategy Suggestions**  
  Include context-specific keywords like: `Academy`, `School`, `Gym`.  
  Add descriptive alt text to the Kids BJJ image on the homepage.  
  _Why: Relevant keywords and alt tags increase visibility in search and improve accessibility._

## Content & Layout Refinements

- **Header Improvements**  
  - Dynamically calculated header height and added it as padding to prevent overlap with page content.  
  - Refactored navigation menu behavior to display as a floating pop-up instead of extending the header background.  
  - Reorganized `<h1>` and logo from stacked layout into a horizontal row for reduced height and visual clarity.  
  - Navigation header now remains fixed during scroll.  
  _Why: These changes improve usability, navigation clarity, and prevent content from being hidden beneath fixed elements._

- **Text Cleanup**  
  Corrected grammar issues, eliminated extra spaces, refined phrasing.  
  _Example: “Women’s Brazilian Jiu Jitsu” section on index.html_  
  _Why: Clean, professional writing improves credibility and user experience._

- **Image Alignment**  
  Centered misaligned images and relocated them for logical flow and visual balance.  
  _Why: Visual consistency improves readability and aesthetic appeal._

- **Mobile Layout Cleanup**  
  Identified and resolved layout bugs causing horizontal scroll or visual inconsistencies on smaller screens.  
  _Why: Ensures a clean, responsive experience on phones and tablets._

- **Footer Overhaul**  
  - Changed copyright:
    ```
    "2025 Gracie Humaita Kansas City. All rights reserved."
    ```
  - Centered `Contact` and `Navigation` sections.  
  - Resized font and upgraded headers (`Contact`, `Navigation`) to `<h4>` elements.  
  _Why: Clear structure improves legibility and helps users navigate the site more easily._

- **Link & Navigation Fixes**  
  - Updated “Trial Program” link on the Adults BJJ page to redirect to the Free Trial page instead of Zen Planner login.  
  - Standardized link styling across all pages to match the main page appearance.  
  - Adjusted link button widths for better balance and spacing.  
  - Enabled home page section buttons to scroll users to the correct section ID on `adults-bjj.html`.  
  - Adjusted anchor scrolling offsets to account for fixed header height.  
  _Why: These changes ensure consistent navigation, cleaner design, and reduce friction when moving through the site._

## Next Steps

- Refine the **Adults BJJ** page:
  - Evaluate the purpose of the “Advanced Program” section. Consider splitting the existing “Curriculum” and “Sport BJJ” sections for clarity.
  - Add a dedicated “Facility” section showcasing training space and amenities.
  - Expand on “A Huge Adults Program” with specific details — number of students, presence of law enforcement, program history, and community legacy.
  - Improve the “Reasons for Women” section by revising language, removing redundancy (e.g., repeated terms like "self-confidence").
  - Consider rewriting the “Kids BJJ” section entirely, emphasizing storytelling and keeping impactful quotes.

- Create a dedicated **Competition Team** page:
  - Highlight the modern competitive success and camaraderie of the team.
  - Feature recent media/photos and mention training times such as **Sunday Competition Practice**.

- Awaiting final image selections from the client to apply explicit width and height for improved CLS and Accessibility.
- Finalize caching policy for static assets via `vercel.json` for repeat-visit performance gains.
- Add CSP, COOP, and XFO headers to further improve Best Practices compliance and browser security.

_These refinements will be implemented after client approval to maximize compliance with modern web standards._
