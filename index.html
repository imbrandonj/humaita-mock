    <h3>We represent the Family that started Mixed Martial Arts.</h3>
    <p>Our Mission is to provide a unique training environment for all. 
      Our main focus is increasing strength and agility through the Best Self-Defense System against Larger and Stronger opponents; Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. 
      Our philosophy aligns with the Bushido Code of the Samurai whose pillars include Righteousness, Courage, Honor and Loyalty. 
      Our classes are for all levels from Beginner to Professional Fighter.</p>

    <h3>Fundamental Gracie Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ)</h3>
    <p>Gracie Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is the single most effective martial art you can learn for self defense. 
      Unlike most martial arts, Jiu Jitsu doesn’t rely on size and strength. 
      It’s all about leverage and joint manipulation.</p>

    </picture>
    <p>A smaller person could easily use BJJ techniques to defeat a much larger and stronger opponent. 
      Since real-world fights often end up on the ground, training in a martial art that focuses exclusively on ground combat is both practical and prudent. 
      An added bonus of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is that it will get you in shape.</p>
    <ul>
      Lessons Include:
      <li>Headlock and Pinned Down Escapes</li>
      <li>Escaping Bear Hugs, Body Locks, and Chokes</li>
      <li>Solutions to counter sucker punches, kicks, and takedown attempts</li>
      <li>Knife, Gun, and other Deadly Object Defensive Tactics</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Women's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h3>
    <p>Why should a female be part of Gracie Humaita? 
      As a martial art designed to allow the weaker to defeat the stronger, BJJ is a perfect fit for women who are interested in learning how to protect themselves. 
      And who wouldn't be, right?</p>

    <p>The Gracie Humaita Kansas City Women's Program combines a comprehensive self-defense curriculum with emphasis on drills that simulate realistic attack and escape situations.<br><br>
      The techniques are complemented by a strong fitness component that is second to none compared to classes offered in regular gyms. 
      These are one-on-one private lessons with an instructor specifically designed to keep women safe and increase awareness. 
      Women are more than welcome to attend the normal group classes as well.</p>

    <h3>Kid's Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</h3>
    <p>In 4200 hours you could graduate from college, get your Masters Degree and your Ph.D. 
      So why wouldn't you let your child spend this valuable time learning skills that will last a lifetime? 
      When our kids get out of school, their parents know that their child is being trained in real life skills. 
      With our busy 21st century schedules, it's hard to find the time and resources to really help them with these important life skills.</p><br>

    <p>You would think and expect that they would learn about perseverance, positive mental attitudes, self-discipline and goal setting in school, but they really don't. 
      Students who attend Gracie Humaita Kansas City have an advantage over others because we teach them about these important life skills and how to develop them to their fullest! 
      They learn success traits that will pay off for the rest of their lives.</p>
